2.5 Punteros a funciones

Tarea 1 - Check if the function pointers and the function calls give the same output - They do, all return 8.
Tarea 2 - Change the function pointer to point at resta1(). The result is now 4.
Tarea 3 - Interchange function types, assign suma1() to p_oper2. Even though they are not the same type it still works. I don't understand why, is it due to compiler optimization, or that all the parameters is sent to the stack?
